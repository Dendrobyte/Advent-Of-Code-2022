# Advent of Code 2022 - Mark Bacon

Advent of Code submissions for 2021. Let's see if I finish this year? Hopefully they stay easy until the JLPT is over...

## Information

Once the JLPT N3 is wrapped up, I look forward to [livestreaming these on my YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/markbacon78) as a part of a series I'll be starting called "Leetcode Livestreams" (but I'll probably need to think of a different name). A nice, creative way to kick things off!

Make sure to try challenges on your own before you do this. I'll start commenting the code when it gets unreadable. If you want comments or explanations, reach out to me on [Twitter at @Mobkinz78](http://www.twitter.com/Mobkinz78) and I'll add those! It might not be as readable for beginners as I realize.

Lastly, I chose Python because it's a quick language and I'm looking to get very good at it for interview questions in the inevitable future. May use Go for the hell of it later on. Thanks for stopping by!

  - Log: The prompt was kinda convoluted. Part 2 I just used maps, but I'm sure there's a simpler way. I didn't want to waste too much time trying to optimize code length or anything.
